## 🤓 Case <a name = "case"></a>

As a developer and expert on SQL, you were contacted by a company that needs your help to manage their database which runs on PostgreSQL. The database provided contains four entities: Employee, Office, Countries and States. The company has different headquarters in various places around the world, in turn, each headquarters has a group of employees of which it is hierarchically organized and each employee may have a supervisor. You are also provided with the following Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## 🛠️ Docker Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

---

## 📚 Recover the data to your machine <a name = "data_recovery"></a>

Open your terminal and run the follows commands:

1. This will create a container for postgresql:

```
docker run --name nerdery-container -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:15.2
```

2. Now, we access the container:

```
docker exec -it -u postgres nerdery-container psql
```
C:\Users\arago\OneDrive\Escritorio\nerdery-repos\DB-Nerdery-Challenges\src\dump.sql
3. Create the database:

```
create database nerdery_challenge;
```

5. Close the database connection:
```
\q
```
C:\Users\arago\OneDrive\Escritorio\nerdery-repos\DB-Nerdery-Challenges\src\dump.sql
4. Restore de postgres backup file

```
cat /.../dump.sql | docker exec -i nerdery-container psql -U postgres -d nerdery_challenge
```

- Note: The `...` mean the location where the src folder is located on your computer
- Your data is now on your database to use for the challenge

## 📊 Excersises <a name = "excersises"></a>

Now it's your turn to write SQL queries to achieve the following results (You need to write the query in the section `Your query here` on each question):

1. Total money of all the accounts group by types.

```sql
SELECT type, SUM(mount) AS total
FROM  accounts
group by type
```
<p align="center">
 <img src="src/my-results/result1.png" alt="result_1"/>
</p>

2. How many users with at least 2 `CURRENT_ACCOUNT`.

```sql
SELECT count(u.name) as user_w_least_two_accounts
FROM users AS u
         INNER JOIN accounts AS a ON u.id = a.user_id
WHERE a.type = 'CURRENT_ACCOUNT'
HAVING count(a.id) >= 2;
```
<p align="center">
 <img src="src/my-results/result2.png" alt="result_2"/>
</p>

3. List the top five accounts with more money.

```sql
SELECT id, mount
FROM accounts
ORDER BY mount DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
<p align="center">
 <img src="src/my-results/result3.png" alt="result_3"/>
</p>

4. Get the three users with the most money after making movements.

```sql
    DO
    $$
        DECLARE
            account_balance RECORD;
        BEGIN
            FOR account_balance IN
                WITH account_balances AS (SELECT u.name,
                                                a.account_id,
                                                a.mount        AS initial_mount,
                                                COALESCE(SUM(
                                                                CASE
                                                                    WHEN m.type = 'TRANSFER' AND m.account_from = a.id
                                                                        THEN -m.mount
                                                                    WHEN m.type = 'TRANSFER' AND m.account_to = a.id
                                                                        THEN m.mount
                                                                    WHEN m.type = 'IN' AND m.account_from = a.id
                                                                        THEN m.mount
                                                                    WHEN m.type = 'OUT' AND m.account_from = a.id
                                                                        THEN -m.mount
                                                                    WHEN m.type = 'OTHER' AND m.account_from = a.id
                                                                        THEN m.mount
                                                                    ELSE 0
                                                                    END
                                                        ), 0) AS movement_total
                                        FROM users AS u
                                                INNER JOIN accounts AS a ON u.id = a.user_id
                                                LEFT JOIN movements AS m ON a.id IN (m.account_from, m.account_to)
                                        GROUP BY u.id, u.name, a.account_id, a.mount)
                SELECT account_id,
                    (initial_mount + movement_total) AS update_balance
                FROM account_balances

                LOOP
                    UPDATE accounts
                    SET mount = account_balance.update_balance
                    WHERE account_id = account_balance.account_id;
                END LOOP;
        END
    $$;

    SELECT u.name || ' ' || u.last_name AS full_name, a.mount
    FROM users AS u
    INNER JOIN accounts AS a ON u.id = a.user_id
    ORDER BY a.mount DESC
    LIMIT 3;
```

<p align="center">
 <img src="src/my-results/result4.png" alt="result_4"/>
</p>

5. In this part you need to create a transaction with the following steps:

    a. First, get the ammount for the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` and `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` after all their movements.
    ```sql
     SELECT id, mount
     FROM accounts
     WHERE accounts.id = '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf' OR accounts.id = 'fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590';
    ```

    <p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result5A.png" alt="result_5"/>
    </p>

    b. Add a new movement with the information:from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` make a transfer to `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` mount: 50.75

    ```sql
    DO
    $$
        DECLARE
            movement               RECORD;
            updated_account_record RECORD;
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO movements(id, type, account_from, account_to, mount)
            VALUES (gen_random_uuid(),
                    'TRANSFER',
                    '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf',
                    'fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590',
                    50.75)
            RETURNING * INTO movement;

            IF (SELECT mount FROM accounts WHERE id = movement.account_from) < movement.mount THEN
                RAISE INFO 'Invalid movement: Insufficient balance in account %. Rolling back.', movement.account_from;
                ROLLBACK;
                RETURN;
            END IF;

            FOR updated_account_record IN
                UPDATE accounts
                    SET mount = CASE
                                    WHEN id = movement.account_from THEN mount - movement.mount
                                    WHEN id = movement.account_to THEN mount + movement.mount
                        END
                    WHERE id = movement.account_from
                        OR id = movement.account_to
                    RETURNING *
                LOOP
                    RAISE INFO 'Updated account %', updated_account_record.id;
                END LOOP;

            RAISE INFO 'Transaction successful';
            COMMIT;
        END
    $$;
    ```
    <p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result5B.png" alt="result_5"/>
    </p>
    c. Add a new movement with the information:
        from: `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf` 
        type: OUT
        mount: 731823.56
    
        * Note: if the account does not have enough money you need to reject this insert and make a rollback for the entire transaction
    ```sql
    DO
    $$
        DECLARE
            record          RECORD;
            accounts_record RECORD;
        BEGIN
            INSERT INTO movements(id, type, account_from, account_to, mount)
            VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'OUT', '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf', NULL, 731823.56)
            RETURNING * INTO record;

            UPDATE accounts
            SET mount = mount - record.mount
            WHERE id = record.account_from
            RETURNING * INTO accounts_record;

            IF accounts_record.mount < 0 THEN
                RAISE NOTICE 'Invalid movement: Insufficient balance in account %. Rolling back.', record.account_from;
                ROLLBACK;
                RETURN;
            END IF;

            RAISE NOTICE 'Transaction successful: Movement ID %, Account ID %, New Balance %.',
                record.id, accounts_record.id, accounts_record.mount;

            COMMIT;
        END
    $$;
    ```

    d. Put your answer here if the transaction fails(YES/NO):
    failure:
    <p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result5C.png" alt="result_5"/>
    </p>
    success:
    <p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result5C2.png" alt="result_5"/>
    </p>
    e. If the transaction fails, make the correction on step _c_ to avoid the failure:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO movements(id, type, account_from, account_to, mount)
    VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'OUT', '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf', NULL, 1000.05)
    RETURNING * INTO record;
    ```

    f. Once the transaction is correct, make a commit
    ```sql
    RAISE NOTICE 'Transaction successful: Movement ID %, Account ID %, New Balance %.',
        record.id, accounts_record.id, accounts_record.mount;

    COMMIT;
    ```

    e. How much money the account `fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590` have:
    ```sql
    SELECT id, mount
    FROM accounts
    WHERE id = 'fd244313-36e5-4a17-a27c-f8265bc46590';
    ```
    <p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result5E.png" alt="result_5"/>
    </p>

6. All the movements and the user information with the account `3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf`

```SQL
WITH user_info AS (SELECT u.id                         AS user_id,
                          u.name || ' ' || u.last_name AS fullname,
                          u.email,
                          u.date_joined,
                          a.id                         AS account_id
                   FROM users u
                            INNER JOIN accounts a ON u.id = a.user_id
                   WHERE a.id = '3b79e403-c788-495a-a8ca-86ad7643afaf')
SELECT ui.fullname,
       ui.email,
       ui.date_joined,
       m.type,
       m.account_from,
       m.account_to,
       m.mount
FROM user_info ui
         LEFT JOIN movements m
                   ON m.account_from = ui.account_id OR m.account_to = ui.account_id;
```
<p align="center">
     <img src="src/my-results/result6.png" alt="result_6"/>
